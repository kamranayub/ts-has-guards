# typed-collections

TypeScript utility types that augment built-in collection types like Map, Set,
FormData, and URLSearchParams to offer type guarding capability to
getters/setters.

## Getting Started

Choose your poison:

```
deno add jsr:@kamranayub/typed-collections

npx jsr add @kamranayub/typed-collections
yarn dlx jsr add @kamranayub/typed-collections
pnpm dlx jsr add @kamranayub/typed-collections
bunx jsr add @kamranayub/typed-collections
```

This library was built with [Deno](https://deno.com).
